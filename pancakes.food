Pancakes

Dry ingredients:

1 cup flour
1 tbsp sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 cup salt

Mix dry ingredients.

Wet ingredients:

1 whole egg
3 tbsp oil
"7/8 cup" of milk

Mix wet and dry ingredients until *somewhat* smooth. This is a balance.
Your flour *must* be incorporated with the rest of the ingredients, *but* you also want lumps in your batter. If the batter is too thin and too smooth your pancakes will be crepes.
